        <h1>Welcome to My Personal Site</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Nathan Medina and I am a student attending El Camino College. I am an undergraduate student with a Bachelor's 
            Degree in History from California State University, Long Beach. I have returned to school to study CIS and recieve a 
            Certificate of Achievement for Cybersecurity. I have had a large interest in computers for many years and I have sought
            to understand them better and work in a field that could help other's in their issues with computers and other devices.
            I have already finished a semester in the Spring of 2024 and I look forward to the classes in the coming semester!
